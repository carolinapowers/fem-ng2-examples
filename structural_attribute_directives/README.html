<h3>Structural and Attribute Directives</h3>

<p>Asterisks denote structural directives (<code>ngFor</code>, <code>ngIf</code>, etc.). Structural directives affect the element on which they are initialized in the context of the DOM. For example, <code>*ngIf</code> inserts and removes its element from the DOM based on the expression passed to it.</p>

<p>Brackets denote attribute directives (<code>ngStyle</code>, <code>ngClass</code>, etc.). These don&#39;t change the layout of the element as such, they just provide hooks into different pieces of the element&#39;s functionality. As an example, <code>[ngClass]</code> takes an expression that applies a class name based on a value defined in the component.</p>
