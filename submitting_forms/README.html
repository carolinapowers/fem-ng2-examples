<h3>Submitting a Form</h3>

<ol><li>We DO NOT need to add an <code>ngControl</code> or <code>ngControlGroup</code> to a form, Angular provides that functionality by default</li><li>We DO still need to add a local template variable for the form and set it to the <code>ngForm</code> directive</li><li>We use event binding to bind to the native <code>submit</code> event and pass in the form instance to our method</li><li>Inside our submission method, we can use the same boolean values as the other controls and control groups to perform different actions based on the state of the entire form</li><li>As a bonus, we can disable submission until the entire form is valid. We do this by binding a button&#39;s <code>disabled</code> attribute to <code>!localFormVariable.valid</code>.</li></ol>
