<h3>Injecting a Service into a Component</h3>

<p>We inject a service into a component simply by importing the service, and then creating a reference to it in the constructor of our component, giving it the type of our service.</p>

<p><code>ts
...
import { MyService } from &#39;./services/my.service.ts&#39;;
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(service: MyService) {
    this.stuff = service.performAction();
  }
}
</code></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> when using the service in a different class method, we should just be able to use it via <code>this.service</code>. However, depending on the version of Angular you are using, you may need to set <code>this.service = service;</code> explicitly in the constructor.</p></blockquote>
