<h3>Injecting a service into another service</h3>

<p>Inject a service into another service by importing it, and declaring a variable in the constructor with the type of the imported service.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> don&#39;t forget to make it injectable</p></blockquote>

<p><code></code>`ts
...
import { Injectable } from &#39;angular2/core&#39;;
import { AnotherService } from &#39;./services/another.service.ts&#39;;</p>

<p>@Injectable()
export class FirstService {
  constructor(service: AnotherService) {
    this.stuff = service.performAction();
  }
}
<code></code>`</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> when using the service in a different class method, we should just be able to use it via <code>this.service</code>. However, depending on the version of Angular you are using, you may need to set <code>this.service = service;</code> explicitly in the constructor.</p></blockquote>
