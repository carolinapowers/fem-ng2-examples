<h3>Route Params</h3>

<p><strong>Route config</strong>: add a value name with a colon in front of it to a route&#39;s path</p>

<p><strong>Route link</strong>: in the array you provide to <code>routerLink</code>, add an object with the value name as the key</p>

<p>Query params work the same way except you do not need to declare them in the route config.</p>
