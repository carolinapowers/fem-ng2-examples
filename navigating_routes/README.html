<h3>Navigating to a Route in the Template</h3>

<ol><li>To navigate to a route in the template (we&#39;ll use a link as an example), we place a <code>routerLink</code> directive on the anchor tag, and we bind an array of parameters to it.</li><li>These parameters consist of the name we gave the route, as well as any route parameters.</li></ol>

<h3>Navigating to a Route from a Component</h3>

<ol><li>Import <code>Router</code> from <code>@angular/common</code> and inject it into the component</li><li>Call <code>navigate</code> on the router instance and pass in the same params you would when navigating from the template.</li></ol>
